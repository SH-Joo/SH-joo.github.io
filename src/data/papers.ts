      background: "Skip-connected encoder–decoder architectures still suffer from information loss, limiting recovery of fine high-frequency details.",
      motivation: "Existing U-Net variants cannot guarantee perfect reconstruction and often suppress high-frequency components unintentionally.",
      solution: "SUPER introduces selectively suppressed perfect reconstruction, enriching representational diversity and improving thin-crack segmentation."

    booktitle:"Automation in Construction",
    note: "JCR, Civil Engineering 1/182.",

    content: {
      background: "Early detection of micro-cracks is crucial, but vision models struggle to identify them due to spectral bias.",
      motivation: "Most benchmarks, including SOTA, do not account for spectral bias, leading to vulnerability in detecting thin cracks.",
      solution: "Achieved significant performance improvement over SOTA through a Frequency-Aware design and a Topology-Aware Loss."
